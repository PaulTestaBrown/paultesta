abstract: 'Context: Reductions in population mobility can mitigate virus transmission
  and, in turn, disease-related mortality. But do social distancing policies in response
  to COVID-19 actually change population behavior and, if so, what political, socioeconomic,
  and epidemiological factors condition this policy effect?Methods: We leverage subnational
  variation in the stringency and timing of state-issued social distancing policies
  to test their effects on population mobility from March to December 2020 across
  109 states in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. We also explore how conventional
  explanations of compliance, including political trust, socioeconomic resources,
  health risks, and partisanship, modify these policy effects.Findings: In Brazil
  and the U.S., mandatory stay-at-home orders and workplace closures jointly reduced
  mobility, especially early in the pandemic. In Mexico, where federal government
  intervention created greater policy uniformity across states, workplace closures
  produced the most consistent reduction in mobility. Conventional explanations of
  compliance perform well in the U.S. but not in Brazil and Mexico, with the exception
  of socioeconomic resources.Conclusions: In addition to new directions for future
  research on the politics of compliance, the article offers insights for policymakers
  about which public health measures are likely to elicit compliance. Our finding
  that the efficacy of workplace closures at reducing population mobility increases
  with levels of socioeconomic development suggests that cash transfers, economic
  stimulus packages, and other policies that mitigate the financial burdens of the
  pandemic may help reduce population mobility by decreasing the costs of staying
  at home.'
