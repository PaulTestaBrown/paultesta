abstract: Why do COVID-19 social distancing policies vary so widely across states
  in federal countries? This mixed-methods study of Brazil, Mexico, and the United
  States finds that state-level variation in the stringency of social distancing policies
  is driven not by the epidemiological, demographic, or socioeconomic factors commonly
  emphasized in previous research, but largely by political factors. Introducing a
  novel framework for explaining pandemic policymaking, the study shows the central
  importance of political parties, presidential power, and governors' coalitions in
  determining state-level policy stringency. In the United States and Mexico, statistical
  and qualitative evidence indicates that interstate collaboration among governors,
  combined with top-down pressures from national party elites and presidents, led
  to greater policy alignment among coordinated states. In Brazil, in contrast, where
  there is little evidence of either policy coordination or alignment, state-level
  policies resulted instead from intrastate factors and diffusion. Together, these
  findings highlight how a multilevel framework attuned to varied combinations of
  intra-unit, cross-unit, and cross-level causal factors strengthens our understanding
  of pandemic policymaking.
