abstract: In the view of many, heritable human genome editing (HHGE) harbors the remedial
  potential of ridding the world of deadly genetic diseases. A Hippocratic obligation,
  if there ever was one, HHGE is widely viewed as a life-sustaining proposition. The
  national go/no-go decision regarding the implementation of HHGE, however, must not,
  in the collective view of the authors, proceed absent thorough public engagement.
  A comparable call for an \"extensive societal dialogue\"was recently issued by the
  International Commission on the Clinical Use of Human Germline Genome Editing. In
  this communication, the authors lay out the foundational principles undergirding
  the formation, modification, and evaluation of public opinion. It is against this
  backdrop that the societal decision to warrant or enjoin the clinical conduct of
  HHGE will doubtlessly transpire.
