abstract: Members of Congress (MCs) are concerned about reelection and act in office
  with this goal in mind. Whether citizens notice this behavior and how they respond
  remains an open question. We examine the relationships between legislators' characteristics
  and activity and their constituents' evaluations of their performance in office.
  We argue that MCs' behavior does filter down to citizens, but that their responses
  are conditioned by their partisanship and interest in politics. Our analyses combine
  2006 and 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Study survey data on citizens with
  information on legislators' activity in office in the 109th and 110th Congresses.
  The results reveal that there are widespread linkages between MC behavior and constituency
  approval, but that legislators' copartisan, outpartisan, and independent constituents
  respond in different, yet predictable, ways. Moreover, these effects are strongest
  among the most interested constituents. Our findings have important implications
  for our assessments of legislators' strategies and constituency representation.
