abstract: 'Collaborations between the academy and governments promise to improve the
  lives of people, the operations of government, and our understanding of human behavior
  and public policy. This review shows that the evidence-informed policy movement
  consists of two main threads: ( a) an effort to invent new policies using insights
  from the social and behavioral science consensus about human behavior and institutions
  and ( b) an effort to evaluate the success of governmental policies using transparent
  and high-integrity research designs such as randomized controlled trials. We argue
  that the problems of each approach may be solved or at least well addressed by teams
  that combine the two. We also suggest that governmental actors ought to want to
  learn about why a new policy works as much as they want to know that the policy
  works. We envision a future evidence-informed public policy practice that ( a) involves
  cross-sector collaborations using the latest theory plus deep contextual knowledge
  to design new policies, ( b) applies the latest insights in research design and
  statistical inference for causal questions, and ( c) is focused on assessing explanations
  as much as on discovering what works. The evidence-informed public policy movement
  is a way that new data, new questions, and new collaborators can help political
  scientists improve our theoretical understanding of politics and also help our policy
  partners to improve the practice of government itself.'
