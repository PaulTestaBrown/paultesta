abstract: When parties decide, do voters listen? We argue that the answer depends
  on voters' trust in the institutions of American politics. Using both a conjoint
  experiment and a traditional survey experiment with subjects voting in hypothetical
  congressional primary elections, we find that respondents from both parties are
  more likely to support a candidate when that candidate is endorsed by a member of
  the party or when the candidate has previously served in elected office. However,
  these findings are conditional on trust and partisanship. For Democrats, we find
  that support for party-backed candidates erodes among low-trust respondents. Low-trust
  Democrats are particularly resistant to candidates endorsed by traditional party
  elites such as Speaker Pelosi, President Obama, and the Democratic Congressional
  Campaign Committee, and are less likely to support experienced candidates. While
  low-trust Republicans are more skeptical of endorsements from traditional party
  actors like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the most salient attribute for
  Republicans is an endorsement from President Trump, which significantly boosted
  support in both studies independent of trust. Our findings support party-centric
  theories of primaries but suggest that voter distrust in the political system threatens
  parties' control over their nominations.
