abstract: "Context: Educating the public through information campaigns is a commonly\
  \ used policy approach to public health problems. Yet, experimental methods that\
  \ assess the impact of information campaigns may misestimate their effects by failing\
  \ to account for respondents' willingness to receive new information. Methods: This\
  \ article uses a doubly randomized survey experiment conducted on a nationally representative\
  \ sample, where some subjects are randomly assigned to an informational treatment\
  \ about opioids while other subjects are given the choice of whether to receive\
  \ treatment or not, to examine how public willingness to seek new information shapes\
  \ the way they update their preferences about policies related to the opioid epidemic.\
  \ Findings: Among those likely to receive information, treatment has a large positive\
  \ effect on increasing support for policies that address the opioid epidemic by\
  \ about one half of a standard deviation. Among those who would avoid this information,\
  \ preferences appear to be unmoved by treatment. These effects would be missed by\
  \ standard experimental designs. Conclusion: While redressing information asymmetries\
  \ is only one part of a public health strategy for addressing the opioid epidemic,\
  \ our findings highlight the importance of access to and receptiveness toward new\
  \ information."
