This course provides an introduction into the basics of quantitative, empirical research in the social sciences. We will begin exploring three main types of statistical inference–causal, descriptive, and predictive. Next will we develop some core tools for statistical inference from probability and statistics and finally, apply what we have learned to an empirical research project. Each class will be divided into two parts. The first part will consist of lecture and discussion around the week’s assigned topics. The second part of class will involve applied data analysis using R an open source program available for download at https://cran.r-project.org/. We will work through examples and provide an opportunity get started on that week’s work together. All data and readings not listed among the required texts are available on the course website, as are additional supplemental materials, such as slides, notes, code.
