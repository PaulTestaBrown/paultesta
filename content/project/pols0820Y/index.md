This course examines the politics of race and the criminal justice system in the U.S. It proceeds in three parts. First, it examines the political origins and  consequences of racial disparities in citizens' interactions with the police, courts and prisons. Next, it considers how the public, the media, and politicians relate and respond to these issues. Finally, the course concludes by examining the prospects for reform and the consequences of inaction.
