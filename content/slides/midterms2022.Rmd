# Will the polls get it right this time?

## Why do we care?

- Elections have consequences

--

- Election polling has consequences

  - Campaigns
  
  - Media
  
  - Voters
  
--

- It matters whether the polls get it right







---
## Will the polls get it right it 2022?

To answer this question, we ask the following about polls:

- How do they work?

- How do we use them to forecast an election?

- How have they done in the past?

- How will they do in the future?


But first...

# Polls: How do they work?

---
## Polling

- A poll is a survey conducted on sample from a population

- The theory of polling depends on the power of **random sampling**

- The practice of polling tries to account and adjust for **all the ways a poll can fall short** of this theoretical ideal


---
## Polling Elections

- **Pollster:** Who's doing the survey

--

- **Sampling frame:** A list from which the sample was drawn

--

- **Sample size:** How many people were surveyed

--

- **Survey mode:** How the survey was conducted

--

- **Survey instrument:** What the survey asked

--

- **Survey weights:** Adjustments to make the survey more representative of the population

--

- **Likely voter model:** A way of distinguishing (likely) voters from non-voters

--

- **Margin of error:** A range of plausible values for the true population value

## The Challenge of Election Polling

- The population is unknown

- Response rates are low

## Polling Error

Total Survey Error in Election polling is a function of:

- Sampling Error

- Temporal Error

- Non-Sampling Error

---
## Polling Error

Total Survey Error (how far off a poll's estimate is from the truth) can be broken down into different parts:

- **Sampling Error:**
  - That error that arises from sampling from a population
  
  - Sample Size $\uparrow$ $\to$ Sampling error $\downarrow$
  
  - Margins of error typically only reflect sampling error

---
## Polling Error

Total Survey Error (how far off a poll's estimate is from the truth) can be broken down into different parts:

- Sampling Error:

- **Temporal Error:**

  - The error that comes from polling a dynamic race at specific point in time
  
  - Polls closer to the election $\to$ Temporal Error $\downarrow$


---
## Polling Error

Total Survey Error (how far off a poll's estimate is from the truth) can be broken down into different parts:

- Sampling Error:

- Temporal Error:

- **Non-sampling Error:**
  - Errors that arise from how a poll is implemented and analyzed
    - Coverage error: Sampling Frame $\neq$ Population
    - Response bias: Some people are more less likely to take a poll
    - Measurement bias: Question wording, order, can influence responses
    - Processing and adjustment error: Failing to weight for key demographics

## 12 News/Roger Williams University Poll – August 2022

- **Pollster:** Fleming & Associates
- **Sampling frame:** Probability Sample of Registered Voters
- **Sample size:** 405
- **Survey mode:** Live Caller with land and cell phone
- Survey Instrument: See cross tabs of the questions here [Questions](https://www.wpri.com/democratic-primary-poll-results-august/)
- **Survey weights:** None that I can tell
- **Likely Voter Model:** Hard to say, but based on past surveys probably two-part screener:
  - Are you registered to vote?
  - How likely are you to vote in the Democratic Primary?
- **Margin of Error:**

$$
\begin{align}
MoE &= \pm 4.9 \\
    &= 1.96 *\sqrt{((p*(1-p))/405)}\\
    &= 1.96 *\sqrt{((0.5*(1-0.5))/405)}\\
    &= \pm 4.869659
\end{align}
$$

## Evaluating a poll

.pull-left[
Two criteria

- Did they call the race correctly?
  - Yes! McKee won

- Did they get the margin right?
  - Not exactly...
  - McKee one by about 3% percentage points over Foulkes, not Gorbea

# 💡
# Polls: How do we use them to forecast an election?

---
## Forecasting Elections

- Election forecasts reflect varying combinations of:

  - Expert Opinion
  - Fundamentals
  - Polling

- Forecasts differ in the extent to which they rely on these components and how they integrate them in their final predictions

---
## FiveThirtyEight's Approach to Forecasting

![](images/forecast538.png)

---
## Forecasting Elections

- The preeminence of polling in modern forecasts reflects the success of Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight in correctly predicting the 2008 (49/50 states) 2012 (50/50) presidential elections 
  
  - Any one poll is likely to deviate from the true outcome
  
  - Averaging over multiple polls $\to$ more accurate predictions than any one poll, provided...

  - the polls aren't **systematically** biased

- The present concerns over polling the failure of such approaches to predict 
  
  - Trump's Victory in 2016
  
  - Strength of Trumps Support in 2020

## Polling the 2016 Elections

  
---
## Polling the 2016 Election:

- The polls missed bigly
--
  - National polls were reasonably accurate (Clinton wins Popular Vote)
  - State polls overstated Clinton's lead / understated Trump support

[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/13/upshot/putting-the-polling-miss-of-2016-in-perspective.html)

---
## How did we get it so wrong in 2016?

![](images/forrecast2016.png)
Some likely explanations

- Likely voter models overstated Clinton's support

- Large number of undecided voters broke decisively for Trump

- White voters without a college underrepresented in pre-election surveys

## Polling the 2018 Elections


---
## 2018: A brief repreive?

- Polls did a better job
  - Most state polls weighted by education
  - Underestimated Dems in House and Gubernatorial race
  - No Partisan Bias in Senate Races
- Forecasts correctly call:
  - Democratic House
  - Republican Senate

However...

## Polling the 2020 Elections

background-image:url("https://media.giphy.com/media/26FmQ3zBr4i0SqR0s/giphy.gif")
background-size:cover

---
## 2020: Historic Problems, Unclear Solutions

- Average polling errors for national popular vote were 4.5 percentage points -- **highest in 40 years**

- Polls overstated Biden's support by 3.9 points national polls (4.3 points in state polls)

- Polls overstated Democratic support in Senate and Guberatorial races by about 6 points

- [Forecasts predicted](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/) Democrats would hold 

  - 48-55 seats in the Senate (actual: 50)
  - 225-254 seats in the House (actual: 222)

---
## 2020: What when wrong

- Unlike, 2016, currently no clear explanation for why the polls missed

.pull-left[

**Not a cause:**

- Undecided voters
- Failing to weight for education
- Other demographic imbalances
- "Shy Trump Voters"
- Polling Early vs Election day voters

]

--
.pull-right[
**Potential Explanations**

- Covid-19
  - Democrats more likely to take polls
- Unit non-response
  - Between parties
  - Within parties
  - Across new and unaffiliated voters

## Why the polls might be wrong

- After 2016, we had a reasonable idea of what went wrong, and how to fix it (e.g. weight for education)

- Lack a similar explanation for the polling errors of 2020.

- [AAPOR Report](https://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Reports/2020-Pre-Election-Polling-An-Evaluation-of-the-202.aspx) lays out three scenarios going forward. Problems in 2020: 
  - Persist in 2022 and beyond
  
  - Are Unique to Presidential Elections (Problem for 2024, but not 2022)
  
  - Unique to 2020/Covid/Trump (Not a prolbem )

1. No historic bias

## Should we trust the polls to get it right this time?

--

- Ask me November 10

- Polling is hard, and getting harder
  - Fundamental Nonresponse challenges seem real
- Pollsters are innovative, and forecasts are flexible
- What's the alternative
  - Experts? 
  - Fundamentals?
- Will the polls get it right?
