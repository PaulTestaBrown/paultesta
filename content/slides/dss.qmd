# {.inverse}

[Can sharing personal experiences with abortion change public attitudes about this issue?]{.big-text}



## Our argument {.smaller}

- Citizens [understand politics]{.blue} through the lens of [personal experience]{.blue}

- Personal experiences are [more persuasive]{.blue} than general arguments

- Abortion attitudes are [hard to change]{.blue} but ...

- Personal narratives are [potentially persuasive]{.blue}

- Persuasion depends on both [reception and response]{.blue} to messages


## The personal is political{.smaller}

- Citizens [learn about politics]{.blue} through their [personal experiences]{.blue}

  - Policy feedback [@Campbell2012-ue; @Lerman2017-xx; @Weaver2019-kh]; 
  - Deliberative democracy [@Mansbridge1999-kk; @Cramer_Walsh2004-jn]
  - Political knowledge [@Cramer2017-zb]


- [Personal narratives]{.blue} can be a [powerful rhetorical frame]{.blue}

  - Narrative frames are easier to understand [@Bilandzic2013-nk]
  
  - Episodic structure more emotionally engaging [@Gross2008-gf]

## Why personal narratives might persuade {.smaller}

- Some evidence from [observational studies]{.blue} that personal narratives

  - Reduce stigma [@Cockrill2018-ul]
  - Elicit more positive comments on YouTube [@Kubin2021-fq]

- But [experimental results]{.blue} are more mixed

  - Null results from: 
    - Deep canvassing [@Broockman2017-rd]
    - Narrative stories at Planned Parenthood [@Sackeim2020-qo]
  - Effects for individually tailored arguments [@Kalla2022-if]
  

## Persuasion and choice{.smaller}

- @Zaller1992-oq Receive-Accept-Sample model of opinion formation

  - Attitude formation depends on [both the reception and response to information]{.blue}
  
  - Typically only study one aspect of this dynamic

- Dynamics of [choice and self-selection]{.blue} are ever-present in everyday life, but [absent in most studies]{.blue} of persuasion
  
- When reception predicts response, [this is a problem]{.blue}

## The problem {.smaller}

- [Average Treatment Effects]{.blue} ($ATE$s) tell us the effect [if everyone were to receive the treatment]{.blue}

- We can think of it as a [weighted average]{.blue} of the effects among those [likely and unlikely to encounter the treatment]{.blue}

- When treatment effects vary depending on who receives the message, the [$ATE$ can be misleading]{.blue}

  - Example: The same message delivered on [Fox News vs. MSNBC]{.blue}

## Legal 

By law, do you think women should have access to abortion if she...  *(Yes/No)*

:::{.nonincremental}
- has already been pregnant for six weeks  
- has already been pregnant for more than one trimester (more than 12 weeks of pregnancy)  
- was not using birth control  
- has a partner who disagrees with her decision  
- has already had an abortion before  
- wants an abortion for any reason

:::

How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements regarding abortion? *(7-point scale: Strongly disagree – Strongly agree)*

:::{.nonincremental}

- State law should require a woman to attend multiple appointments over several days in order to get an abortion.  
- State law should prohibit private health insurance from covering abortions.  
- State law should require women to receive counseling that advises childbirth over abortion.  
- State law should require that publicly-funded health insurance for poor people covers the cost of abortions.

:::

Assume this hypothetical scenario: your state is considering a number of ballot measures during the next few years.   Below are some of the ballot measures under consideration.  Would you favor or oppose each ballot measure that would prohibit doctors from performing abortions on patients who are:  *(5-point scale: Strongly oppose – Strongly favor)*

## Action

:::{.nonincremental}

These days people are busy and often don’t have time to do many of the things they would like to. Suppose in the next month someone asked you to engage in the following activities.  How likely would you be to say yes?  *(5-point scale: Not at all likely – Extremely likely)*

- Volunteer for an organization that supports women who need abortions.  
- Accompany a friend or family member to an abortion appointment.  
- Protest outside an abortion clinic to show my opposition to abortion.  
- Call a politician to express my support for legal and available abortion.  
- Call a politician to express my opposition to legal and available abortion.

:::


## Moral

How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements regarding abortion?  *(7-point scale: Strongly disagree – Strongly agree)*

:::{.nonincremental}


- Women who have had abortions have done something wrong.  
- Women who have had abortions should feel badly about themselves.  
- If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she should consider an abortion.  
- Given the availability of modern birth control, women who have abortions are just irresponsible.  
- There’s nothing wrong with having an abortion.

## Affect

Use the thermometer below to express how you feel toward the following individuals and groups.  *0 is most cold. 100 is most warm.*

## Summary

:::{.nonincremental}

With a total sample size of 1,500 (split between forced exposure and treatment choice conditions), our design is powered at 80% (with a two-tailed $\alpha = 0.05$) to detect the following minimum effect sizes:

- [H1:]{.blue} 0.10  
- [H2:]{.blue} 0.25  
- [H3:]{.blue}  
  - 0.70 when one-third of respondents select into treatment

# Implications, limitations, and broader applications {.inverse}

## Implications

- Reading a [personal narratives]{.blue} about abortion is [persuasive]{.blue}

- But primarily [among those who would otherwise avoid them]{.blue}

  - Standard experimental designs -- even with subgroup analyses -- would miss these dynamics

- [Understanding persuasion]{.blue} requires us to study both the [reception and response]{.blue} to messages

## Limitations {.smaller}

- It is [difficult to perfectly recreate]{.blue} the choices people face

  - Binary choice vs. multiple options
  - Some choices are made for us

- Just because [this personal narrative]{.blue} was persuasive [doesn’t mean all narratives are]{.blue}

- Use caution when interpreting results from a [single study]{.blue}

  - Duration of effects, competing messages, different messengers, different contexts


## Broader applications{.smaller}

- Incorporating choice into experimental designs allows us to ask and answer a broader range of questions of interest to academics, activists, organizations and anyone trying to reach a particular or multiple audiences.

- Once you bring choice into a design, there's so much more you can do:
  - [Randomize the choice people get]{.blue}
    - Binary choice vs. multiple options
    - Messenger and format
  - [Randomize the information provided]{.blue}
    - Pro vs con
    - Expected vs unexpected messages
  - [Randomize conditional on choice]{.blue}
    - Could a different message persuade a skeptical audience?
