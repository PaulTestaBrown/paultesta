## What happened?

:::{.panel-tabset}

## Overview

- Trump [wins the Presidency]{.blue} (~312-226 electoral votes)

- Republicans [flip the Senate]{.blue} (51-57 seat majority)

- Control of the House [still in play]{.blue} (probably won't know for a while)

## A red shift

# {{<fa magnifying-glass>}} Why did it happen?

## Why did it happen? {.smaller}

- Why did Kamala/Democrats lose?

- Why did Trump/Republicans win?

- What's the counterfactual?

- What would have happened had:

  - Biden not run for re-election
  - The Republicans nominated Nikki Haley
  - Had we accepted higher unemployment for lower inflation?

## Types of explanations {.smaller}

- It's the [campaigns]{.blue}

- It's about [specific groups of voters]{.blue}

- It's about the issues: [immigration, abortion, democracy, crime, culture war]{.blue}

- It's about the issue: ["it's the economy, stupid"]{.blue}

- It's about [racism, sexism, transphobia, xenophobia]{.blue}

- It's about the [vibes]{.blue} (anti- establishment/elite/incumbency )

::::{.fragment}
It's probably about all of these things, to some degree. Beware of singular explanations and broad generalizations.

## Early exit polling

::::{.panel-tabset}

## Overview

These are mostly from [CNN's exit polling](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/politics/2020-2016-exit-polls-2024-dg/) as well as [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls) and [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/) 

The margins can and will change when weighted against the final results

# {{<fa magnifying-glass>}} What have we learned...

## ...About the polls {.smaller}

[Are the polls fundamental broken?]{.blue}

- [Yes]{.blue} Missed the strength and depth of Trump;s support in three elections

- [No:]{.yellow} Wait for the final counts. The absolute polling error likely within historical margins

- [Yes:]{.blue} The forecasts were off in all the battleground states

- [No:]{.yellow} Forecasts showed a 50-50 race in which a Trump sweep was the most likely (of many) possible battleground outcomes

- [Yes:]{.blue} Polls like the Selzer/Iowa poll missed bigly

- [No:]{.yellow} But polls that took a more aggressive weighting approach were more accurate

- [Yes:]{.blue} It's unclear that their strategies were anything but luck/fear of getting it wrong (e.g. [weighting on past vote](https://goodauthority.org/news/election-poll-vote2024-data-pollster-choices-weighting/) tended to increase support of Harris )

- [No:]{.yellow} Still the polls picked up evidence of racial depolarization, education polarization, shifts in PID that shaped the election....

## Can we trust the polls?

- Polling is hard.

- Polling with Trump on the ticket is particularly hard

- My answer is always relative to what?

  - Pundits vibes/conventional wisdom? Yes
  - Prediction markets? Honestly, still probably yes.
  
- Polls are useful even when they're wrong


# {{<fa magnifying-glass>}} What comes next?

## What comes next?

- A lot depends on the House

- Congress has several biases toward the status quo and inaction (super-majoritarian Filibuster)
  
  - National abortion ban, 20% tariffs seem unlikely. But so did Trump's second term...
  
- More worried about the Executive Branch

  - Less oversight, fewer guardrails, more particular harms (immigration, judicial appointments, civil service, foreign policy)

- How much does Trump care about governing?
  
  - How much does Trump care about score settling
  
  
## What comes next? {.smaller}

- A lot depends on you

- Politics is about power

- To wield power you need to win elections

- Winning elections requires coalitions 

- Building coalitions requires compromise

- It's a lot of work, that often happens at a more local level

- But it's worth it. And it's more important than ever.
